To validate my theoretical model, I generated a synthetic turbulent velocity field using a Fourier‐space construction. In this approach, each mode in a periodic domain is assigned a random phase and an amplitude scaled as

The resulting figure shows the computed energy spectrum of the synthetic velocity field (obtained via radial averaging in Fourier space) overlaid with a reference line corresponding to

 In summary, my kinetic molecular turbulence theory posits that turbulence originates from the random, collision-induced deviations of individual molecules. Although these interactions occur at a microscopic scale, their collective effect, when averaged, yields the well‑known energy cascade seen in turbulent flows. Kolmogorov’s scaling laws describe this cascade by predicting that in the inertial range the energy spectrum follows a

 , the resulting macroscopic behavior is consistent with Kolmogorov’s theory. In other words, even a turbulence model rooted in molecular collisions will, when averaged, yield the same inertial range scaling as described by Kolmogorov.
